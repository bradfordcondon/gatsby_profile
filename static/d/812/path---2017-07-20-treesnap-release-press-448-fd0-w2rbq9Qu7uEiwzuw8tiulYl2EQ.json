My major project since then has been designing, coding, and releasing the mobile citizen science app TreeSnap.  I think it's a fantastic project, and I'd love it if you <a href=\"https://treesnap.org\">visited the app's website</a> to learn more. </p>\n <!--more-->\n<h1>What is TreeSnap?</h1>\n<p> In short, the app aims to connect tree lovers and scientists by asking citizens to report \"survivor\" tree species threatened by pests and disease.  Users answer a few question, snap a few pictures, and the app sends the information, along with GPS coordinates, to <a href=\"https://treesnap.org/map\">the TreeSnap server</a>.  There, scientists who study disease resistance or run tree breeding programs can use the collected data for their research, or follow up and collect tissue/pollen/seed for their research!</p>\n<h1>TreeSnap in the news</h1>\n<p>I'm grateful to Carol Spence for interviewing Dr. Ellen Crocker (the extension specialist on TreeSnap) and myself about TreeSnap.
