{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This post is part 8 of a series on bioinformatics file formats, written for the 2017 UK-KBRIN Essentials of Next\nGeneration Sequencing Workshop at the University of Kentucky.</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Newbler is a software package for <em>de novo</em> assembly of 454 sequencing data.  It is available for free from Roche as part of the GS <em>de novo</em> Assembler package.  While Roche may have discontinued support for it, you may still find yourself working with output from this assembler.</p>\n<p>It outputs many files.  I've excerpted the description from the manual, and a table of the column labels and their meaning for each file.</p>\n<h2><code class=\"language-text\">Assembly project.xml</code></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tab-delimited file giving position-by position consensus base and flow signal information. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will not be going over this file, as its intended to be machine-readable.</p>\n<h2><code class=\"language-text\">454AlignmentInfo.tsv</code></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The 454AlignmentInfo.tsv file contains position-by-position summary information about the consensus\nsequence for the contigs generated by the GS De Novo Assembler application, listed one nucleotide per line (in a tabdelimited\nformat). Output conditionally (using the -info/-infoall/-noinfo options or the selection made on the GUI\nParameters Tab Output Sub-tab). By default, this file is only output if there are fewer than 4 million input reads and\nthe total length of assembled contigs is less than 40 Mbp. For larger projects, -info or -infoall or the corresponding\nGUI Output selection for Alignment Info must be used to generate this file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>column</th>\n<th>Label</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Position</td>\n<td>Position in the contig</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Consensus</td>\n<td>Consensus nucleotide at that position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Quality Score</td>\n<td>Quality score of consensus base</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Unique Depth</td>\n<td>Number of unique reads at that position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Align Depth</td>\n<td>Number of reads at that position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Signal</td>\n<td>Average signal of the read flowgrams for the flows that correspond to that position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>StdDeviation</td>\n<td>Standard deviation of the read flowgram signals at that position</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><code class=\"language-text\">454readstatus.txt</code></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tab-delimited text file providing a perread\nreport of the status of each read in\nthe assembly.
