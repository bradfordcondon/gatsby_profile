{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Back in September last year, <a href=\"/2013/09/14/ethical-implications-of-the-stem-cell-burger/\">I explored some possibilities that the “Stem Cell burger” opened up.</a>  Perhaps the most far-fetched idea I had was to produce meat from cloned celebrity stem cells.</p>\n<p>It seems this idea wasn’t as absurd as I thought.  A new company has launched called <a href=\"http://bitelabs.org/\">Bitelabs</a>, claiming they will produce celebrity-derived meats in salami-form.<figure style=\"width: 487px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"></p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image\" id=\"i-309\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-28-at-12-48-52-pm.png?resize=487%2C157\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />\n<p>So is it a hoax or a real company?  The <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/02/26/bite_labs_is_probably_a_prank_artisanal_salami_from_celebrity_tissue_samples.html\">internet isn’t quite sure what to make of it.</a>  My previous post covered the feasibility of such an endeavor, but the ethics remains a gray zone. In the meantime, I fully support the discussion, and I applaud Bitelabs’ understated strategy.  Personally I’d be interested in trying a cloned meat product, regardless of who the donor was.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Celebrity burgers a reality"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2014-02-28-celebrity-burgers-a-reality/"}}
