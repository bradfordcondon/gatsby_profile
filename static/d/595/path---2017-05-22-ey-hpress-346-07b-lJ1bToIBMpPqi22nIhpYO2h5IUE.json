The conference was funded by an NSF EPSCoR (National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research for Education and Outreach)  grant which I, along with Ellen Crocker and Susan Odom, was a PI on.\nI'm very grateful for all of the volunteers, corporate partners, parents, teachers, and students who made this conference a success.</p>\n<p>The deprecated site is available <a href=\"http://www.expandingyourhorizons.org/conferences/UKLex/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>About the conference</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) is a conference for girls in middle school and their parents/ guardians.\nThis day-long event will include hands-on activities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for girls and educational sessions for parents/ guardians. At the conference, girls will get a chance to meet STEM role models and learn more about careers in those fields. Our ultimate goal is to motivate girls to become innovative and creative thinkers ready to meet 21st Century challenges. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To learn more about EYH, visit the <a href=\"http://www.eyhn.org/\">national website</a>.</p>\n<h2>Press</h2>\n<h4>Post Conference</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://news.ca.uky.edu/article/out-box-future\">Out of the Box, Into the Future, UK Ag News, May 11 2017</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Why are you all here?” Crocker asked the participants. “We need you.
