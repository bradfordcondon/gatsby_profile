It looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&gt;my_sequence1\n4 39 8 4 50 1 100 5 0\n&gt;my_sequence2 \n3 3 40 42 35</code></pre></div>\n<p>Similar to FASTA format, each sequence is defined with a header starting with the <code class=\"language-text\">&gt;</code> character, and all subsequente characters after the line break describe the sequence.  Unlike FASTA, the individual nucleotides are not included in this file, only the corresponding quality Phred-format scores.\nAt this point, all we need to understand is what are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score\">Phred quality scores</a>.  Every nucleotide in a sequence will have a quality score associated with it.  The score <code class=\"language-text\">Q</code> describes the probability <code class=\"language-text\">P</code> that the base is called in correctly:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Q = â€“10 log(P)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let's look at some example Phred scores below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phred score</th>\n<th>Probability incorrect</th>\n<th>% likelihood correct call</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1 in 2</td>\n<td>50%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1 in 10</td>\n<td>90%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>1 in 100</td>\n<td>99%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>1 in 1000</td>\n<td>99.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>1 in 10,000</td>\n<td>99.99%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>1 in 100,000</td>\n<td>99.999%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>1 in 1,000,000</td>\n<td>99.9999%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Phred scores typically range from 2-40 with current sequencing technology.  As you can see, setting a cutoff somewhere around <code class=\"language-text\">30</code> or higher results in fairly strict confidence in invidual base calls.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"qual format"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017-07-09-qual_format_phred/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
