The conference website is hosted <a href=\"http://www.endophyte.uky.edu/ngs/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>FastQ sequence format</h1>\n<p>FASTQ was originally developed by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute to bind together FASTA sequences with their respective quality data.  It is now the standard for high-throughput sequencing output.</p>\n<h2>The format</h2>\n<p>FASTQ is a four-line per sequence format.  If it looks like the raw sequence of your read takes up more than four lines, you probably have word-wrapping enabled.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">@SEQ_ID\nGATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT\n+\n!&#39;&#39;*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*&#39;&#39;))**55CCF&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CCCCCCC65</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Line 1</h3>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">@SEQ_ID</code> is  analogous to the <code class=\"language-text\">&gt;SEQ_ID</code> line of a FASTA file.  Like a FASTA title line, everything before the space is the sequence <em>identifier</em> and everything after the first space is the optional sequence <em>description</em>.</p>\n<p>Note that different sequence sources have different standards for the description line here.\nSequences off of an illumina machine will follow this format:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">@Instrument_name:flow_cell_lane:tile_number_in_flowcell:x-coordinate:y-coordinate#index/pair1</code></p>\n<p>So for example, </p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">@myInstrument:1:3:100:200#2/2</code> describes a read off of myInstrument.  The read was on tile number 3 of flowcell lane 1, located at X=100 Y=200, index number 2, pair #2 of a paired-end read. </p>\n<p>Note that these standards do change: for example, in Casava 1.8 extra information is added and the description is as follows:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">@Instrument_name:runID:flow_cell_ID:flow_cell_lane:tile_number_in_flowcell:x-coordinate:y-coordinate</code> <code class=\"language-text\">pair:filtered/not_filtered:index_sequence</code>.</p>\n<p>If you need to examine the description line of your reads, make sure you know what format is being used.</p>\n<h3>Line 2</h3>\n<p>Line 2 is the actual sequence.</p>\n<h3>Line 3</h3>\n<p>Line 3 begins with the <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> character followed by the sequence identifier (and description).  This identifeir and description is optional: the <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> is not.</p>\n<h3>Line 4</h3>\n<p>Line 4 contains the quality values for the sequence detailed in line 2.  This line must therefore contain the exact same number of characters as line 2: each base has a corresponding sequence score.</p>\n<p>Ordered from lowest quality (<code class=\"language-text\">!</code>) to highest quality (<code class=\"language-text\">~</code>), these are the quality score characters</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">!&quot;#$%&amp;&#39;()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"FASTQ format explained"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017-05-14-fastq_format_explained/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"]}
