As of 2017-06-26, there were 968 instructors.  Am I lucky number 1,000?  Probably not.  Still, exciting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/carpentry/d_carp.png\" alt=\"Data Carpentry\"> <img src=\"/img/carpentry/s_carp.png\" alt=\"Software Carpentry\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/\">Software Carpentry</a> and its sister organisation <a href=\"http://www.datacarpentry.org/\">Data Carpentry</a> are really impressive.  All of their lessons are on GitHub, so you can access them for free, contribute, or see older versions.  If you are an instructor, you'd be crazy not to at least look at the lessons.  You can use them in your own class, for free, under a <a href=\"https://software-carpentry.org/license/\">Creative Commons - Attribution License</a>!  Not only that but there are video recordings of the lessons available online.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the instructor workshop!  I hope to post some thoughts and learning outcomes here next week.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software and Data Carpentry"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017-09-25-Software_Data_Carpentry/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"]}
