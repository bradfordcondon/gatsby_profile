Note that I have a mix of media types (annotated powerpoint files, notebook scans, raw text). While Evernote holds them all seamlessly, printing to this PDF (and into a paper notebook) results in clunky blank pages. There is also no support for printing header information: ie experiment name, tags, dates... I have to manually write the file name on each page afterwards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>**Traceable.  **Ultimately, a lab notebook is for tracing the lineage of data.  Whether this is at the troubleshooting or the writeup phase, I need to understand what the starting material, protocol, and resulting output were at each stage of the experiment.  Science is seldom perfect, and a good lab notebook can prevent some confusing mixups (was that DNA sample prepared before or after I optimized the pH of buffer X?)  Here is where Evernote isn’t perfect, largely because this is a science problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m looking forward to trying out <a href=\"http://findingsapp.com/\">Findings</a> and reporting back how it improves on these key issues (and others I haven’t thought about).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lab notebook software"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2014-10-29-lab-notebook-software/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
