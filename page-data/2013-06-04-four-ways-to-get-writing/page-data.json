If I can’t write because I’m thinking about my sister, I call her.  If I’m hungry, I eat.</p>\n<p>By the same token, sometimes I <em>can</em> write.  On these days, I cancel commitments and appointments.  I live that day as if writing were the only task on my desk.</p>\n<p>Rather than seeking to control my productivity, I work with it.</p>\n<h2>3.  Write the shitty, plagiarized first draft</h2>\n<p>I am not  a perfectionist, really.  I’m not even a details person.  But when it comes to writing, it’s really tough for me to get going.  Oddly, the toughest section is writing the introduction (more on that later, perhaps) where what I need to say has already been written, a thousand times.</p>\n<p>By blatantly plagiarizing whole sections from other people’s reviews and my own writing elsewhere (and highlighting the sections so I don’t forget, of course), I can move on, revise, and build off of what’s on the page.  I no longer try to rewrite what has been said again and again (a more unpleasant task, to me, than blazing a new trail with new data)- I go with what’s been said, and after things are in place, I reshape it to my needs.</p>\n<h2>4.  Get active</h2>\n<p>Seriously.  Go to the gym, go for a run, shoot some hoops.  Sometimes I just clean my house for an hour (in fact, I think my apartment is only clean when I have a deadline looming.  This may not be for everyone, as it’s a trait I share with my mother, but not my father.).  I leave the music at home, and busy my body while clearing my mind.  When I return to my desk, I’m often reset and ready to work.</p>\n<p>If you are reading this, then I wish you the best of luck on your project.  Get back to work!  And if you can’t, and you don’t have a real world deadline breathing down your neck, go take care of yourself!  Because you deserve it, and you’ll function better if you aren’t burnt out.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Four ways to get writing"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013-06-04-four-ways-to-get-writing/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"]}
