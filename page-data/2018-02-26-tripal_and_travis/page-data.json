This means every time code is committed, we test three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade a Tripal 2 site to Tripal 3</li>\n<li>Install Tripal 3 on a clean site</li>\n<li>Run PHPUnit tests</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tripal/tripal_passing.png\" alt=\"tripal passing!\">\nIs there anything more fulfilling than seeing a <em>Build:Passing</em> tag on your repo?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The General Idea</h2>\n<p>Even small changes to the code base can have unintended consequences.  Continuous Integration running on a pull request means you know, before you merge the pull request, whether or not the new code will pass all your tests.  </p>\n<p>In the case of Tripal, we wanted to clear the way for PHPUnit testing.  Testing is interesting when you work in Drupal 6 and 7: Drupal switched to PHPUnit support in Drupal 8.  Especially as a novice developer, you ask yourself, should I bother learning the old framework (simpletest) when I know that PHPunit is just around the corner?</p>\n<p>Turns out with a little bit of work, PHPUnit works just fine with Drupal 7.  This means we can add test coverage to our code and be aware when new changes break old functionality.  Plus, because we build new sites from scratch, we can rest assured that new users trying out Tripal won't be faced with a broken build.</p>\n<h2>The Build Script</h2>\n<p>The full build script (<code class=\"language-text\">.travis.yml</code>) we went with is below.
