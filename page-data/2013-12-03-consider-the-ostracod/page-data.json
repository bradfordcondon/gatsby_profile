Photo from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ostracod.JPG\n<p>Observing our ostracod (we named her Sue) scooting around under the microscope was a joy.  My curiosity for Sue was fed by an excellent website by Robin James Smith at the Lake Biwa Museum<strong>edit</strong> this website has since been taken down.  </p>\n<p>The amazing thing about biology is that a simple walk through the woods can ignite an entire afternoon of looking through a microscope and learning something new and bizarre.  I now know that ostracods can produce spermatozoa up to ten times their body length, can be bioluminescent, and can hunt in groups!  Every organism has an untold story, with so much left to learn and be discovered.  And thanks to the unbelievable scope and rigor of science, a discovery can easily climb the scaffolds of human knowledge.  We can just as easily reach the peak, and wonder at the reality just beyond our comprehension.</p>\n<p>I don’t think one needs a PhD to appreciate the beauty of the world.  Anyone who is excited to explore life, big or small, is a scientist in some way.  The life of a ‘real’ scientist is filled with lab notebooks, presentations, grant proposals, budget forms.  But these things are carried out in exchange for that spark of wonder that can be found in a muddy pond in the woods, in our blood, or floating in the Atlantic.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Consider the ostracod"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013-12-03-consider-the-ostracod/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"]}
