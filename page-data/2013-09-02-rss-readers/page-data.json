They come in all shapes in sizes, from feature heavy standalone apps to minimalist browser integrated readers.  Shop around and go with what feels good- the most important thing is that you can integrate it into your work flow.  I used to use <a href=\"http://www.rssowl.org/\">RSSowl</a> for my feeds, which is also free.  But, as a standalone app, I used it less and less, until I stopped checking my feeds all together.  The most important rule for any app is that you use it!</p>\n<p>For me, I will use a program if it fits well into my existing workflow.  I skim headlines in my reader.  Items of interest are sent to either pocket, evernote, citeulike, or scoop.it, depending on if they are for my personal consumption, work-related, or science outreach and communication related.  I will expand on these specific avenues in a later post.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"RSS readers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013-09-02-rss-readers/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
