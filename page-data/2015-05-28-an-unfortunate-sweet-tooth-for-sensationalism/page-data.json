 Who?  Does the scientist work for a biased source?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.  Was the finding published in a peer-reviewed journal?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3.  Can you find the article?  Do the conclusions the authors draw in the abstract reflect what is reported in the newspaper?</strong></p>\n<p>How would my students fare if they were given this article?  It turns out, not so well.  Here are my answers, working from <a href=\"http://instituteofdiet.com/2015/03/29/international-press-release-slim-by-chocolate/\">Bohannon’s press release</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Question **</strong>1:  Is the finding reported by a scientist?  Does the scientist work for a biased source?**</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n  Johannes Bohannon is presented as the research director of the nonprofit Institute of Diet and Health, a fictional institute.  They have a website that is intentionally minimalist.  It doesn&#8217;t look incredibly legitimate, but it also doesn&#8217;t scream crazy.  I imagine most students would give it a pass, despite the possibility that, say, this fictional institute is funded by Nestle.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Question 2:**</strong>  Was the finding published in a peer-reviewed journal?**</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n  Yes of course it was!  Here&#8217;s the real problem predatory journals present to the common reader going forward.  <a href=\"http://www.intarchmed.com/\">The International Archives of Medicine</a> (IAM) is a legitimate enough sounding journal.  The Journal&#8217;s website has an ISSN, citation metrics, and assurances that it is included in the JournalGuide whitelist of reputable titles.  As Bohannon reports, this journal <em>used </em>to be reputable, as it was published under<a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/\"> BioMed Central</a>, a trustworthy open-access publisher.\n</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n  In short, one would need to do some serious digging to realize the journal is bogus.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Question 3.  Can you find the article?  Do the conclusions the authors draw in the abstract reflect what is reported in the newspaper?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n  Yes and yes.  This is an easy one, because Bohannon&#8217;s wrote both the press release and the article.\n</p>\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s clear that we have a problem here.  What prevents someone from doing poor work (or fabricating work) and “publishing” the work in predatory journals?  Nothing.  And unless some sort of watchdog agency is set up to accredit peer-reviewed journals, this will not change any time soon.  If real scientists can’t distinguish a quality journal from a predatory one, what chance do non-scientists have?  As it is, I find Beall's list of questionable publishers to be the most useful resource for investigating journals.  <strong>edit:  Beal's list has been taken down.</strong>   But this is a list built by a science librarian who saw a problem, and can’t be expected to be definitive or exhaustive.  The JournalGuide, cited on IAM’s website, appears to be a reasonable resource in its own right (it’s listed in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/rate-that-journal-1.17225\">this Nature article</a> on resources for evaluating journals), but obviously it’s not perfect if IAM is listed.</p>\n<p>If policing publishers isn’t the answer, then what can be done?  Bohannon’s piece makes one thing abundantly clear: the popular media did not do their homework on this piece.  Many magazines ran the story without contacting Bohannon at all.  If he was contacted, he was never contacted by someone who knew enough about science to ask the right questions.  In short, science journalism lack skepticism.  It seems that most magazines will run an article without asking the three questions I listed above.  And even if they do, it’s clear that a more careful tact must be taken in the future to prevent spreading misinformation.</p>\n<p>Until that day arrives, I urge you, the reader, to bring a healthy dose of skepticism to every new miracle finding you read, especially related to human health, sexuality, and diet.  Do your homework, because no one else is doing it for you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An unfortunate sweet tooth for sensationalism"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2015-05-28-an-unfortunate-sweet-tooth-for-sensationalism/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"]}
