It's free, it let's people easily find, use, and contribute to your source code.</p>\n<h4>Associate the GitHub repository with Tripal</h4>\n<p>Once your module is on GitHub, consider <a href=\"https://github.com/tripal/\"><strong>joining the Tripal organization</strong></a>.  Your lab group can exist as a team and maintain control over your code, but your projects will be listed in the main Tripal group.</p>\n<p>If you'd rather not, you can still tag your project as <em>Tripal</em> by clicking on the <em>Manage Topics</em> Link at the top of your repository.</p>\n<h3>DOI</h3>\n<p>When your module is release ready, why not create a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for it with <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/\">Zenodo</a>?  It's free!  Sync your github account and create a <em>new</em> release (Zenodo won't find old releases).  You can then display your DOI badge on your module's page.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is a <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/communities/tripal/\">Tripal Community group</a> on Zenodo.  You can edit your record to associate your DOI with the Tripal community.</p>\n<h3>Testing and Continuous Integration</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://github.com/statonlab/TripalTestSuite\">Tripal Test module</a> is coming soon, which will automatically set up a PHPUnit and Travis testing environment for you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test with PHP Unit.</li>\n<li>Set up Travis continuous integration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>Every repository can include a README file that will be displayed on the repository page.  A README file should at a minimum include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An overview of the module</li>\n<li>Instructions on how to install &#x26; use the module</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider documenting your Code itself.  Tripal documents in the <a href=\"http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/\">Doxygen style</a> which allows documentation webpages to be automatically generated.  Even if you don't build HTML documentation, the in-line code documentation will be very helpful to contributors.</p>\n<h3>Coding Standards</h3>\n<p>Drupal has <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/coding-standards\">defined coding standards</a> that Tripal modules should meet.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tripal best practices"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-03-05-tripal_guide_metadata_practices/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623","3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
