I&#8217;m pretty sure I have too many gadgets for managing my academic references.  I&#8217;d surely be better off if I spent more time reading the literature, and less time setting up new accounts that I&#8217;ll neglect (this blog being a perfect case in point).

Every year for my journal club, I try to get people to use <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/home" target="_blank">Citeulike</a>.  It&#8217;s a great concept- install a browser bookmark, and with one click, import all of the metadata for a paper to your personal library.  Tag it (which I always neglect), and there you go.  It&#8217;s pretty tough to stump the import tool (this wasn&#8217;t always so), so without much effort, it pulls the title, author, abstract, and journal info.

Which is all nice, but it doesn&#8217;t stop there.  Citeulike has all sorts of functionality for sharing papers with a dedicate group, or just e-stalking a scientist you have a crush on (or who stays on top of the literature).  In theory, this means you&#8217;ll be plugged into your academic community, noticing new publications and seeing who is reading what.

In practice, it&#8217;s been a bit more lonely.  As it is, I use it as a citation repository for articles I haven&#8217;t read, or read but don&#8217;t want to keep in my papers library (an upcoming post on that!).  My Citeulike library is [here](http://www.citeulike.org/user/bcondon), if you have any interest in fungal genetics, follow me!
