Let's talk about some simple VSCode plugins that have brought a lot of value to my workflow lately.

I am not a VSCode master.  I'm really not an IDE (integrated development environment) master.  I'm not much of a tinkerer, or a perfectionist. I don't spend hours tweaking my config files or reading every manual for every tool I use.

I am, however, a pragmatist.  I strive to use what works, for me (or my company), and prioritize technology investments that offer the most value.  With that in mind, I set out to explore the best, simplest improvements I could make to my VSCode IDE.

Hopping instances in AWS in my day-to-day really limited my IDE useage. It just makes sense to focus on `vim` proficiency if you are working in transient environments where the easiest way to connect is via the `ssm` agent.  Still, I dont think `vim` is the right tool for everyone at all stages in their career (and frankly I think emphasizing it too early is discouraging and gate-keepery).  Last I invested in my IDEs, I was switching over my PHPStorm environment to Sublime Text, and then to Atom.  Now Atom is officially abandoned for VSCode, so I've been figuring out what I Like and need.



# Linting

### PHP
 
`php-md`, while I love it is too opinionated if you are working with legacy code.  

### Javascript

It's delightful that `prettier` continues to rule the roost here.
