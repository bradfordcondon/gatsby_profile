I am trying to write my PhD dissertation.

It&#8217;s going OK, thanks for asking.  But it&#8217;s not going OK all the time.

Some days, I can spend an hour in front of my computer and have nothing to show for it but a lot of purple links on Reddit.

>Surfing the web instead of working? Sounds like time for a run to me. 

<span style="line-height:1.6;">Other days I can literally write, almost nonstop and without distraction, for epic 10 hour sessions.  </span>

So what&#8217;s the trick?  Here is my experience.

**#1.  Deadlines.**

If you are writing your dissertation, then it&#8217;s a safe bet you can meet a deadline.  Be it a term paper, grant application, or conference abstract, my life is littered with deadlines.  And, the week before a deadline, two things happen.  I put down other interesting projects, and I write productively because it has to get done.

But the problem is that a dissertation is such a huge task that it inhabits its own epic time frame.  It will be finished when it is finished, it won&#8217;t be shoved out in a week or a month.  But setting reasonable, artificial deadlines for small pieces of my thesis has allowed me to step out of the lab, enjoy some of that deadline-induced focus, and put digital ink to screen.

**#2.  Write when you can write.**

Why fight it?  I can&#8217;t always write.  If it&#8217;s a nice day out and I can&#8217;t concentrate, I go out and play. If I can&#8217;t write because I&#8217;m thinking about my sister, I call her.  If I&#8217;m hungry, I eat.

By the same token, sometimes I _can_ write.  On these days, I cancel commitments and appointments.  I live that day as if writing were the only task on my desk.

Rather than seeking to control my productivity, I work with it.

**#3.  Write the shitty, plagiarized first draft**.

I am not  a perfectionist, really.  I&#8217;m not even a details person.  But when it comes to writing, it&#8217;s really tough for me to get going.  Oddly, the toughest section is writing the introduction (more on that later, perhaps) where what I need to say has already been written, a thousand times.

>It&#8217;s perfect, because I didn&#8217;t write it! And for right now, that&#8217;s OK!

By blatantly plagiarizing whole sections from other people&#8217;s reviews and my own writing elsewhere (and highlighting the sections so I don&#8217;t forget, of course), I can move on, revise, and build off of what&#8217;s on the page.  I no longer try to rewrite what has been said again and again (a more unpleasant task, to me, than blazing a new trail with new data)- I go with what&#8217;s been said, and after things are in place, I reshape it to my needs.

**#4.  Get active.**

Seriously.  Go to the gym, go for a run, shoot some hoops.  Sometimes I just clean my house for an hour (in fact, I think my apartment is only clean when I have a deadline looming.  This may not be for everyone, as it&#8217;s a trait I share with my mother, but not my father.).  I leave the music at home, and busy my body while clearing my mind.  When I return to my desk, I&#8217;m often reset and ready to work.

If you are reading this, then I wish you the best of luck on your project.  Get back to work!  And if you can&#8217;t, and you don&#8217;t have a real world deadline breathing down your neck, go take care of yourself!  Because you deserve it, and you&#8217;ll function better if you aren&#8217;t burnt out.
