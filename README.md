You're forking my site to build your own?  That's fine, godspeed.

# Gatsby

I switched from Jekyll to Gatsby a while back.  I'm really not sure that was the right move, but here we are.

### Building and deploying

This your first time?

1. clone the repo
2. run `npm i`.  this installs the dependencies such as gatbsy, react, etc.
3. To start developing and building the site, run `npm run develop`.
4.  To deploy changes, execute:  `npm run deploy`.  
5.  If you want to get fancy, set up CI to run deploy for you when you push code changes back to the remote.
